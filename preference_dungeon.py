""" 
This file contains two DungeonMaster classes, which simulate situations that an LLM may encounter
and evaluate its responses to them. 

The SetChoices variant assumes a fill-in-the-blank style encounter where the responses follow a
prescribed format and blanks are filled from a given list. The responses are then evaluated against
a list of acceptable and unacceptable conditions, resulting in a binary ACCEPTED or REJECTED result.

The OpenEnded variant allows the LLM responses to be freeform (though they may be somewhat)
constrained by the prompt, and are evaluated by ROUGE score.

The goal of the game is to learn the preferences inherent in the world, either by logical deduction
(SetChoices) or by matching the training set as closely as possible (OpenEnded).
